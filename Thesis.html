        Nowadays the use of cloud computing is expanding exponentially. With a very short life has
        become a technology that will. Moving data and applications to Internet and access to them
        trough services gives some vantages to organizations. Although today there are still some
        doubts and reservations towards it.
        The final thesis work describes and analizes cloud computing world and specially Eucalyptus,
        a software platform for the implementation of private cloud computing on clusters. As a
        practical work, it have been release a desktop client for interact with Eucalyptus that allow
        users to run and connect to virtual machines inside the system. </p></center>
        <center><p class="pdf">1. (Introduction) <br><br>
            a. Short overview of cloud computing
            The use of Internet and new technologies nowadays, for business and for the current
            users, is already part of everyday life. Any information is available anywhere
            in the world at any time. That was not possible few years ago. Nowadays it
            have arisen a lot of possibilities of access to public and private information like internet
            speed access or the deployment of mobile dispositive that allow the connection to
            Internet from almost everywhere.
             Today a lot of people are consulting their mail online through webmail clients, writing
            collaborative documents using web browsers, creating virtual albums to upload
            their photos of the holidays. They are running applications and storing data in servers
            located in Internet and not in their own computers. Something as simple as enter in a
            web page is the only thing a user needs to begin to use services that reside
            on a remote server and lets him share private and confidential information, or
            using computing cycles of a pile of servers that he will ever see with his own eyes. And
            every day its being used more this services that are called cloud computer services.
            That name is given because of the metaphor about Internet, as something than the
            user see like a cloud and cannot see what’s inside. This services can be offered by free or by paying by demand (pay for consume), can
            be simply like a function calling (like asking the temperature in some city in the
            world for include it in a web page) or complex (like the usage of a virtual machine
            with its own operating system, applications and storage space for running
            applications).
            This means that many users and organizations can avoid install some applications
            in their computer or can have more computational power using cloud computer
            through internet, or they can make their own private cloud to manage it
            completely, or they can use both options for the moments of high demand of
            consume. </p></center>
        <center><p class="pdf">b. (Identify) <br><br> the problem 
            Nowadays a lot of enterprises or users need to process a long amount of information
            data or need to do some complex operations, for example some mathematical models
            calculations, and they need a high amount of process power to resolve it. Maybe the
            power of a personal computer can be not enough to finish in a determinate time one
            task, and maybe this task is so punctual that is pointless to acquire the hardware
            necessary to do it. Also sometimes a user wants to use a program for few times, for
            example for making some practices in university, and maybe it’s pointless to make
            install this user a program, like Scilab, so for both problems we see convenient to bring
            the possibility of use some programs without the needing of install in own computers
            and with the possibility of have more calculation power. So we have to bring to the
            user the necessary tools to be able of executing a problem in the cloud of the
            university.
            As we will see after, Eucalyptus is a software that allows the management of a private
            cloud infrastructure, we are not going to enter now in technical explanations, but the
            truth is that a user that wants to run Scilab in the cloud don’t need to know about the
            infrastructure that contain this program, we have to remember than users are working
            with applications, not with infrastructure. It’s also true that for handling with
            eucalyptus user needs to know their commands and how to use them, so it is needed
            to deploy a friendly user interface to permit to users open Scilab in the cloud in a
            comfortable way, forgetting about what it’s inside the system. </p></center>
        <center><p class="pdf">c. (Objective) <br><br> of the thesis
            The objective of the thesis is develop a user friendly interface to access to eucalyptus
            private cloud system and run easily applications hosted inside. To achieve this
            objective we need to found a programming language able to communicate with
            eucalyptus. Eucalyptus works like Amazon EC2 so it means that all the modules of
            eucalyptus works like a web service. This web services are compatible with all
            languages because use standards (xml/soap), so searching a little we can find Typica,
            it’s a Java API that allows communicate with Amazon EC2 and have been tested with
            Eucalyptus, in a very friendly way. Instead of reinventing again this communication in
            java we will use this API, its open source and also in deployment, so it means that
            there’s a community of developers behind giving help and actualizing that API.
            The communication will be deployed with Java, so to deploy the interface it will be
            some Java graphic library. Java Swing is a graphic library for Java that allows creating in
            very easy way graphic interfaces. The IDE NetBeans also have a Swing Gui Builder, also
            known as project Matisse, it is a graphic interface for the creation of graphic interfaces,
            simplifying the design deployment of this ones.
            This will allow me to understand how it works internally a private cloud, how to
            interact with it, and understand witch kind of solutions can provide this technology. It’s
            quite interesting the fact that Amazon EC2 and Eucalyptus use a compatible API because I’m working with an open-source solution that is working like a very used one
            like Amazon EC2.  </p></center>
        <center><p class="pdf">d. Tasks <br><br> of the thesis
            First of all it will be necessary to be on date about this entire world called cloud
            computing. Also its important to be familiar about the history of this product, all the
            technologies that are in contact with it, which are the conditions that encourage to use
            it, which are the problems that arise with it uses,… In other words be familiar with this
            new kind of computation.
            Second task will be identify the problem and the requirements of the solution, having
            in mind who is going to use this and how.
            Later it will be necessary design the solution and implement it, and in all this parts will
            be necessary to write in the documentation of the project what is happening. Finally it
            will be necessary to try the software created and obtain conclusions. </p></center>
        <center><p class="pdf">2. (Cloud computing) <br><br>
            a. Historical view
            In the 60’s John McCarthy said that "computation may someday be organized as
            a public utility". This is just a concept attached to cloud computing. Like if it was
            electricity supplier, user asks for how much it needs and pays as much as he uses, also
            there’s an illusion of infinite supply. But let’s see a little bit of history.
            In the early 60's and 70 companies had large mainframe computers which provided
            services to workers who had access to them through dumb terminals. These
            computers stored all information and did all calculation. From a dumb terminal orders
            were sent to the mainframe and it returned the information to that terminal. But these
            mainframes were very expensive.
            In the 80's, companies realized that servers based on normal computers could be
            installed at lower cost than mainframes. Also this gave users a sense of greater control
            over their actions. So gradually these mainframes were being replaced by computers
            for the users, also because of the decrease of the prices of the personal computers.
            In 90’s with begin of the global use of Internet the fashion of lots of computers
            accessing to one big server came back again. At that time were required web servers
            with plenty of power to hold the requests that were made from the Internet. From
            that time to today more services are offered in Internet and more storage need the
            users of this services. More and more the logic of the applications is being moved in
            servers in Internet from the personal computers thanks also to the increase of speed
            of the access to the net and to the facilities to access (mobile dispositive). Nowadays
            the massive computation needed can be solved by providers that are dedicated to this,
            in this way various users can share the same infrastructure maximizing the efficiency of
            this one and minimizing the coasts. At the finish of the dot.com bubble, finish of the 90’s, normally all data centers were
            using less than 10% of their capabilities because they wanted to reserve the rest for
            the occasional peaks, at that time Amazon made a great effort to solve this problem
            adding capabilities by demand to the users, one of the concepts of cloud computing,
            fast and easy.
            At 1999 Salesforce.com began to delivery services to enterprises by their own website
            and pioneered the concept of software as a service. In 2002 Amazon launched Amazon
            Web Services (AWS), a suite that included storage, computation and others services. In
            2006 Amazon launched Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to small companies and users to
            let users run their own computer applications in the cloud. In 2008, Eucalyptus was
            launched, being the first open source AWS API compatible platform for deploying
            private clouds. In 2009 Google began to offer enterprise applications based in browser
            as Google Apps.

        <center><p class="pdf">III. (Types of clouds) <br><br>
            Public
            Public cloud (also known as external cloud), is the traditional way, where services are
            provided by a third part via Internet, and they are visible to everybody (it doesn’t
            mean that they have to be free). So in the cloud it’s the information of lots of users but
            they can’t access of course to the information of the others.
            Private
            This cloud consists on the hosting of private applications, storage, or computation in
            the same company emulating a cloud in Internet but only for private use (private
            networks). The coast of infrastructure and maintenance of it is the same that having it
            in normal way but the scalability and the sharing of the coasts is better...
            Hybrid
            It‘s a combination of public and private cloud. An organization can have a part of their
            services in its own infrastructure but also in public cloud. Or can use the public just
            when have peaks of usage. It‘s a good option when you want to have your data or
            application in local and don‘t want to invest too much in infrastructure. </p></center>
        <center><p class="pdf">V. (Technologies related) <br><br>
            In this section are going to be explained some technologies that are attached to cloud
            computing.
            Web Services
            It‘s explained before that cloud computing it‘s based in the offer of services, but what
            is exactly a service and how it works? Normally two applications written in different
            languages and executed in different operating systems are not able to communicate
            between them, but exists a group of protocols and standards for exchanging
            information between different applications, no matter in which language are written
            or in which operating system are running. This is really useful, for example over
            Internet, when we don’t know how is implemented an application running on the web.
            This can be possible thanks to organizations like OASIS (Organization for the
            Advancement of Structured Information Standards) and W3C (World Wide Web
            Consortium). This communication is based in plain text. So it‘s not the same efficient as
            other kind of communication like CORBA or RMI. (Remote invocation method)
            The different technologies used for this communication are:
            XML (Extensible Markup Language)
            It’s a metalanguage based on labels. It’s very structured and allows to different
            applications or systems to communicate between them. As it is said in the name is
            extensible, that it means that it allows defining new labels easily.
            SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
            It’s a protocol that defines how two objects of different processes can exchange
            information through XML messages. WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
            Based on XML and it’s the public interface in the world of web services. It describes all
            the services that exist in one location and the way to interact with them.
            UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)
            It’s a catalogue of all web services that exist in Internet, it was an industrial initiative
            but nowadays it’s not really used. It’s written in XML.
            WS-Security (Web Service Security)
            It’s an extension to SOAP to apply security to web services.
            Cloud computing security
            It‘s a set of policies about the security in the cloud focused on computer, network and
            mostly information protection. These policies are about:
            1. Data of one user have be totally isolate from data of another and it have to be
            moved securely inside the cloud.
            2. Use of identities.
            3. Physical infrastructure has to be completely secure and the access to the data
            needs identification.
            4. Access to data have to be always available for the users, it can‘t happen that
            one user cannot access to his own data at one moment.
            5. All the services delivered in the cloud have to be secure.
            6. All sensible data have to be encrypted. The enterprises that need to storage and process a lot of information use normally
            data centers. This data centers usually are racks inside rooms dedicated to that with
            special conditions. Datacenters must include lot of several security policies and
            redundancies of data, power and communication supply. And have to be in special
            conditions, like temperature, humidity, etc.
            Cloud storage
            It‘s the virtualization of the storage of data using the net and usually by third parts.
            There are many companies that have huge data centers that allow to others to store
            on them their date by using virtual servers and storage pools. So the client sees their
            files, which are organized among in different locations in the data center, as if they
            were located physically in the same place. This is very useful because enterprises don‘t
            have to be worried about the infrastructure of their data center but also they pay for
            how much data they are storing there.
            Virtualization of computers
            Virtualization is an abstraction of the resources of a machine between the hardware
            and the operating system, making a virtual version of a resource being possible to
            share it.
            About virtualization of computers, software simulates an entire machine inside of
            another one. Normally is an operating system that is executed as if it was the only one
            running in the computer, but that‘s not real because it’s running together with other
            operation systems and don’t have all the resources of the machine, just a part of them.
            Many users can have access to one virtual machine, they feel that they are working
            alone on that, with access to everywhere but they are just using a part of the machine.
            That software have to manage the principal resources of computer, CPU, RAM, storage
            and network and the system has to be able to allow all users work together. This
            virtualization can be:  </p></center>
